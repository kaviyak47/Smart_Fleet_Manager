Overview

Managing a fleet of vehicles often becomes difficult when tracking fuel usage, service schedules, and maintenance records manually. Smart Fleet Manager solves this problem by predicting important vehicle events like the next fuel refill date, next service date, and odometer target using machine learning. The system takes inputs such as the last fuel refill date, last service date, odometer reading, and average service intervals, then processes them through a Linear Regression model built with Scikit-learn. The results are displayed on a user-friendly dashboard built with React, Flask, and MongoDB, helping fleet owners plan ahead, reduce downtime, and manage their vehicles efficiently.
